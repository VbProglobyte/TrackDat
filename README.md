# TrackDat
An employee tracker 
This is a database using MySQL - the command line is how we will be inserting the data (using Node, Inquirer, MySQL2). To veiw/select the database, you will have to access mysql in the terminal using :

    

## Installation 

Through the command line : open up a terminal under server.js 
    
    1. npm i
    2. npm mysql
    3. npm inquirer
    4. npm start (this will automatically start the promts for the user to select and answer)

## Usage 

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. Build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
