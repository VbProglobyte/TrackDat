# TrackDat
An employee tracker 
This is a database using MySQL - the command line is how we will be inserting the data (using Node, Inquirer, MySQL2). 

## Installation 

Through the command line : open up a terminal under server.js 
    
    1. npm i
    2. npm mysql
    3. npm inquirer
    4. npm start (this will automatically start the promts for the user to select and answer)

## Usage 

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. Build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

To view/select the database, you will have to access mysql in the terminal using :  mysql -u root -p

Once you see that you have successfully logged in to mysql, type in the terminal :  show databases;

from here you can select the desired database (in this case company_db) by typing :  use company_db;
and now you can view your tables and feilds
